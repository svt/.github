# SVT Default Community Health Profile

This is SVT's GitHub Community Health Profile.

What is that? Basically, it is a GitHub feature that adds a few defaults (links really) to projects missing them, see, [Community Health Profiles for an organisation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)


The templates files used here are taken from the [SVT Open Source Project Template](https://github.com/svt/open-source-project-template) so if you intend to use some of them, fork that project instead (not this repo) and adjust to your org/liking.
