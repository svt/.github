# REUSE Compliance check information

This workflow checks if your project is REUSE compliant.
Being REUSE compliant means that it follows a few basic rules regarding license information,
which can be verified by running the REUSE Tool, and make sure it passes a "reuse lint" check.

You can read more about REUSE [here](https://reuse.software/) our at our internal Open Source site. 
Being REUSE compliant is one of the lint rules we have for releasing Open Source software at SVT.
If it is not, you should fix it; it is quite easy - run 'reuse lint' on your project.

See the official docs, or our internal help site [Open Source site](https://opensource.svt.se) for more guidance. If you need more information about this check then contact our internal #opensource or #ospo.
