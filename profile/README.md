[Sveriges Television, The Swedish national public TV broadcaster](https://omoss.svt.se/about-svt.html), builds its services with mainly open source products.
We aim to be good open source citizens and contribute back to the open source 💗 community, by bug fixing or by releasing projects that we think could benefit others.
We also aim to be more transparent in general - for example, we have released the algorithm for our [Election Compass Matcher](https://github.com/svt/election-compass-match).

### Using SVT's Open Source Projects 🏄 

See the README and the documentation for the project you wish to use.
